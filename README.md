#### <a id="user-stories">User Stories</a>
User stories describe the features of an application based on the target audience. Each user story should map directly to a feature and should focus on who makes up the target audience, what they will gain from the feature, and why this feature is being included in the application. User stories follow the format of "As a ____, I want ____ so that ____."

_Why:_
> The application should focus on the targeted audience so you know who you are building it for and why someone would use it. User stories also help identify gaps in the planning process.

As you plan your project, define your user stories and corresponding features. If you have more features than user stories, write more user stories. If you have more user stories than features, write more features.

#### <a id="wireframes">Wireframes</a>
Once you have a concept in mind, create visual representations of your application, called wireframes. A wireframe can be drawn on the whiteboard, on paper, or with online tools. Each page or view of your application should have its own wireframe and some pages may have multiple wireframes to illustrate changes based on user interaction. For example, you may have a wireframe to show how a page appears when it loads, and a second wireframe showing that same page as it will appear when a user selects an option from a drop-down menu or clicks a button.

_Why:_
> Wireframes provide a visualization of your final application. This is useful to make sure the team is in agreement on the general appearance of the application and can help to identify potentially unpleasant user experiences.

#### <a id="conflict-plan">Conflict Plan</a>
Your team should agree on a process for handing disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it if necessary.

_Why:_
> Project week can be stressful and emotions can run high. Put together a plan ahead of time so you all know how to deal with any potential issues later.

As a team, create a Group Agreement as a markdown file to document the following:
* What will your group do when it encounters conflict?
* How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
* What is your process to resolve conflicts?
* How and when will you escalate the conflict if your attempts are unsuccessful?

#### <a id="communication">Communication Plan</a>
Before beginning to write code, determine how your group will communicate with each other, both in person and online. 

_Why:_
> This is not an individual effort. Make sure everyone knows how the group will communicate with each other and that everyone feels comfortable speaking up.

Add your communication plan to your Group Agreement. Some things to consider:
* How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?
* What is your strategy for ensuring everyone's voices are heard?
* How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?

#### <a id="project-scope">Project Scope</a>
Determine which features make up your minimum viable product (MVP). This should include any features you absolutely want to have in your application for presentation day.

_Why:_
> Scope creep can be dangerous! Keeping your project within a pre-determined scope will help the group stay on task without going off on tangents and side features.

Beyond MVP, put together a list of stretch goals to tackle if you have time. During your pitch, your instructor will help you scope your project. Some features may become MVP and some may become stretch goals.
